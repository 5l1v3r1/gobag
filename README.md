Gobag: a standalone ROS bag reader

### What is it?

Gobag is exploration around the idea of fast [ROS](http://www.ros.org/ "Robot Operating System") bag parser that can easily be deployed without ROS stack.

### Installation

It uses Go modules system for dependency management.

In older versions of Go, you need to do the usual `go get <all the dependencies>`.

In Go 1.11 (and working in GOPATH) you can turn on the modules support by this environment variable `export GO111MODULE=on` and then just build. Much more on this [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-to-define-a-module).

In future Go versions (starting 1.12) it should just work automagically as the module support will be switched on by default.

Then build the CLI tool:

```
cd gobag-cli/
go build                                      # or go install
./gobag-cli help
```

**Note**: it works 99.99% of the time with the newest version of [lz4 package](https://github.com/pierrec/lz4), but in case of very large _single_ message (more than 2^10 bytes) the version 1.1 needs to be used (currently newest is 2.0.7).

### Usage

CLI usage is shown below.

Code usage examples are shown in `gobag-cli/actions.go`.

### TODO

* Provide out-of-the-box code samples with a sample bag file
* Benchmarking tests
* Work with lz4 package author to track down the large message regression
